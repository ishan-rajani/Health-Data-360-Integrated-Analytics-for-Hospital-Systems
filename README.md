# Health-Data-360-Integrated-Analytics-for-Hospital-Systems
Health Data 360 is a Tableau healthcare dashboard that brings clinical, operational, and billing data into one view to support hospital decision making. It helps answer key questions:  • Where are readmissions increasing? • How does length of stay vary? • Where are patient flow or data quality issues?  Data is privacy safe and reflects real scenarios.
